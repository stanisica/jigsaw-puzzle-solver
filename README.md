# jigsaw-puzzle-solver

This repository contains a project focused on reconstructing a single image from n smaller, puzzle-like pieces. The core of the project is a custom-developed algorithm designed to accurately and efficiently compare and stitch these pieces together. Utilizing parallel processing, the solution aims to optimize the reconstruction process, even when dealing with a large number of fragments. Please note that this implementation does not rely on pre-existing libraries and has been crafted to leverage the original image as a reference during assembly.
